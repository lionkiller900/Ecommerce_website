# About Ecommerce shoes
Hello everyone! This is E-commerce shoes that sell most shoes ranging from trainers and other types. All you just need to do is to check the foot wears online and choose one. Pick the one that is good for you and check out the product online. Although these are what we have right now, there are more shoes that will be introduced in the future.
This project is my final one that will complete the Full Stack Software Developing Course in Code Institute. 
I treasure this project very much because of its challenging areas that are close to my heart. This is because I am fascinated with several kinds of shoes especially trainers that are new and “shiny” as I call it. This is something most Black British young men do like. Back in my younger days I would take old and worn-out trainers from the streets or waste and patch them into a useful foot ware. This is one of my ways of loving trainers. As technology is becoming part of our daily life, I developed the idea of making online shoe business that can be very appealing to customers. So therefore I developed the Ecommerce Shoe website.

IMPORTANT NOTE: the debug is now off!

# BUGS IDENTIFIED

## Errors identified with Heroku push
There were series of persistent errors encountered when trying to deploy to Heroku through Gitpod. 

One of the most common errors encountered are that the python version (Python 3.6.8) installed into Git do not support the version for pushing into Heroku. The version is needed to be upgraded to Python 3.8.8 for the stack Heroku-20 allowing the push to be successfully built. This is in addition when the required packages for Django to be successful where installed and validated them on requirements.txt.<br>
Another error encountered here is when the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and the HEROKU_HOSTNAME config vars in Heroku were removed while running manage.py collectstatic. AWS Secret and Access keys were then added which made the build-up push to Heroku successful.<br>
There was one enduring problem in that the background image is not showing due to the MEDIA_URL not included for the carousel slide, as it is Django in-built. (remember MEDIA_URL = '/media/' ).<br>
Perherps the strangest error ever occured was with the 500 server Programme Error. Initially, it was though that this is because all the migrated files are corrupted. Then it was suggested that to handle this issue will be to:

- Remove all the migrated files and pycache files except the __init__.py files (they are empty anyways).
Then run
-      python manage.py makemigrations
        python manage.py migrate

and
-      python manage.py showmigrations
to check for the migrated files.
However this was not the case as it is now found that the migrated contained the sqlite3 file somehow and strangly in an unexpected way, after series of investigations. Moreover this means that Heroku is reverting the changes made previously. The only solution done to the problem was:
- go to the Heroku account page
- Go to resources page and destroy the production database and get a new URL using the same website name.

## Flake8
Flake8 is a very useful tool in making your python codes tidy. 
It was used to tell where exactly in a python file there should be some arrangements and tidiness that need to be done.
However there are some information that it will provide that do not need attention. 
For examplesuch as some useful variables that are needed in the codes which will signify that it is not useful. However if you remove these
variables it can lead to certain errors. Other issues that it will prompt up that do not need attention are the migration files.

# STRIPE, EMAIL and SOCIAL MEDIA

## Setting up and using Stripe
- On the Gitpod workspace, with pip3 installed, pip3 install stripe was typed. This links Stripe with Django.
- On the Stripe website, a personal account was made.
- The Stripe secret key and Stripe public key details were set up in the settings.py and env.py. Both keys are available on the API
    section under the Developers section. 
- Test the stripe payment on the account site by making a purchase on the E-commerce website. This will send an alert on how successful
    transaction went. 
- Based on the history logs, the payments should be successful based on the transaction. So here is a sample below:
    <a href="">
        <img src="/wireframes/Log_Payment_success_1.png" alt="Webhooks successful">
    </a>
    <a href="">
        <img src="/wireframes/Log_payment_success_2.png" alt="Webhooks successful">
    </a>
- If the payment is successful it should view a HTTP status as 200(OK).
    <a href="">
        <img src="/wireframes/Webhooks_review.png" alt="Webhooks successful">
    </a>

- If unsuccessful it will display the HTTP status as 404.
    <a href="">
        <img src="/wireframes/Webhook_fail_404.png" alt="Webhooks successful">
    </a>
- Or a HTTP status code 500 status error.
    <a href="">
        <img src="/wireframes/Webhook_fail_500.png" alt="Webhooks successful">
    </a>
- In addition, the events of financial activities can be found on the Events area under the Developers tab.

## Email
- First you must install allauth using:

        pip3 install django-allauth==0.41.0

And then use

        pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

- Then obtain the passcode from your gmail account and paste it into Heroku Config vars. 
- Test the email functionality by signing up. 

**Please note that the email used must be the email created from gmail. (i.e my gmail created.). Also note
that the phone details as well the ecommerceshoes@example.com email are dummy/test contact details; they are not created
or real.
The only real contacts are the social media links in the footer section.**

## Social media
- The website social links are already created such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Telegram. All can be found on the footer.

# DEPLOYMENT

## Git deployment
The project is written using Github and there Gitpod is used to write the code. The work is then committed to git repository. The git repository page was linked to Heroku which means that pushing the work automatically pushes to Heroku even after not installing Heroku into workspace. This means in contrary to popular suggestion, there was no need to use “git push heroku master”. Gitpod was used for project development. The methods to install packages using pip3 and other virtual environments is [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

Moreover depending on how a certain Django might be installed individually, here is how it can be installed manually [here](https://bennettgarner.medium.com/deploying-django-to-heroku-procfile-static-root-other-pitfalls-e7ab8b2ba33b)

These are the steps to clone the project:
-	While in the user git repository page, the “code” button in order to download the particular zip repository. This is cloning the project. The other method of doing this is typing the command line:

        git clone “LINK”
-	The required folder needs to be installed using the command which will install the necessary folder requirements that allow the Django to work effectively.

        pip3 install –r requirements.txt
-	There has to be a file that called the env.py which contains the environmental variables which is at the what is known to be the root of the application. It must look like this

        import os
        os.environ[“ SECRET KEY”]=”the secret key”

The secret key is the unique key set in the settings.py. The purpose of the secret key is to keep the file secure by using a cryptographic signing. The env.py is still added to .gitignore file so as to push this application public.
-	The command 

        “python3 manage.py migrate” 
is used to move models in the database in the process called migration. alternatively the files can be manually migrated from the database. For example the shoes details on my database were migrated to my Django administration account manually. 
-	A superuser must be created using the following command

        “python3 manage.py createsuperuser”

- In order to run the app live from the server the foolowing comad must be typed:

        “python manage.py runserver”

- In addition, the website can be accessed on the admin account for other activities.

        “python manage.py runserver”

- In addition, the website can be accessed on the admin account for other activities. 


## Further work on the requirements.txt
- After the superuser has been created, the procfile must be created so as to declare an application process and the site entry points. It can be created by just using the file tab or created using the command in the workspace:

        “echo web: python app.py > profile”

And must freeze the requirements by using this command:

    “pip3 freeze –local > requirements.txt”

The procfile must require a Gunicorn for it to work. If it is not present then it can be installed using the command:

    “web: gunicorn <name of the project>.wsgi:application”
- Committing the files should be done as follows:

        “git add . (or git add –A)”
        “git commit –m <write your commit message>”
        “git push”

Alternatively you can you can deploy the app to Heroku through using:

    “git push heroku master”

- Then it can be deployed in the Heroku account by going to the “Deploy” tab and then clicking “enable automatic deployment”.  Beneath it then the “Deploy branch” should be clicked which will build the app and can be viewed by just clicking the “Open app” at the top right.

# CREDITS
I want to especially thank majority of the Code Institute members including the tutors and my mentor for their vast amount of help despite my family difficulties I faced during much of the pandemic/COVID season. The season especially was a very difficult period not just for me but for a lot of people who have undertaken this project. Despite this it was a worthwhile of counter battle against such problems and victory was finally achieved.
